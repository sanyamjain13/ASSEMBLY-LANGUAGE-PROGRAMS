# ASSEMBLY-LANGUAGE-PROGRAMS

DIFFERENT TYPES OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMS ON - EMU8086

ASM1 : EVEALUATING EXPRESSION X+Y-Z+24 WHERE THE VARIABLES ARE OF BYTE SIZE ( ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION)

ASM-2 : ADDITION OF A BYTE ARRAY DATA USING LOOP

ASM-3 :  ADDITION OF A WORD ARRAY DATA USING LOOP

ASM-4 : CALCULATE EQUATION X+Y-Z+24 ASSUMING WORD DATA AS BYTE BY BYTE DATA
        X=180H , Y=190H , Z=200H

ASM-5 : CALCULATE EQUATION X+Y-Z+24 ASSUMING DOUBLE-WORD DATA AS WORD BY WORD DATA
        X=180H , Y=190H , Z=200H

ASM-6 : TO CONVERT A PACKED NUMBER WHICH IS OF BYTE TYPE(2 DIGIT)  TO UNPACKED NUMBER
	      CONVERTING 23H - 0203H

ASM-7 : TO CONVERT A PACKED NUMBER WHICH IS OF WORD TYPE(4 DIGIT)  TO UNPACKED NUMBER
	      CONVERTING 1234H - 0102 0304H WHERE Y IS THE RESULT VARIABLE 

ASM-8 : TO CONVERT A UN-PACKED NUMBER WHICH IS OF WORD TYPE(4 DIGIT) TO PACKED NUMBER
	      CONVERTING 1234H - 0034H  

ASM-9 : TO CONVERT A PACKED NUMBER WHICH IS OF DOUBLE WORD TYPE(8 DIGIT) TO UNPACKED NUMBER
	      CONVERTING 01020304H - 1234H WHERE Y IS THE RESULT VARIABLE

ASM-10 : LINEAR SEARCH BY COMPARING ELEMENT TO BE SEARCHED IN THE BYTE ARRAY WITH ALL THE
	       ELEMENTS IN THE ARRAY ONE BY ONE. AND IF FOUND AFTER COMPARE JUMMP TO LABEL FOUND
	       AND SET FLAG=1 OTHERWISE IF NOT FOUND JUMP TOLABEL NOT FOUND AND HALT THE PROCESS
