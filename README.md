>**_DIFFERENT TYPES OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMS ON - EMU8086_**

-**ASM1** : EVEALUATING EXPRESSION X+Y-Z+24 WHERE THE VARIABLES ARE OF BYTE SIZE ( ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION)

**ASM-2** : ADDITION OF A BYTE ARRAY DATA USING LOOP

**ASM-3** :  ADDITION OF A WORD ARRAY DATA USING LOOP

**ASM-4** : CALCULATE EQUATION X+Y-Z+24 ASSUMING WORD DATA AS BYTE BY BYTE DATA
        X=180H , Y=190H , Z=200H

**ASM-5** : CALCULATE EQUATION X+Y-Z+24 ASSUMING DOUBLE-WORD DATA AS WORD BY WORD DATA
        X=180H , Y=190H , Z=200H

**ASM-6** : TO CONVERT A PACKED NUMBER WHICH IS OF BYTE TYPE(2 DIGIT)  TO UNPACKED NUMBER
	 CONVERTING 23H - 0203H

**ASM-7** : TO CONVERT A PACKED NUMBER WHICH IS OF WORD TYPE(4 DIGIT)  TO UNPACKED NUMBER
	CONVERTING 1234H - 0102 0304H WHERE Y IS THE RESULT VARIABLE 

**ASM-8** : TO CONVERT A UNPACKED NUMBER WHICH IS OF WORD TYPE(4 DIGIT) TO PACKED NUMBER
	CONVERTING 1324H - 0034H WHERE IN 1324,1 AND 2 ARE ANY BITS LIKE WE SAY IN UNPACKED
	WE GENERALLY HAVE 0 AS ANY BIT IN A BYTE'S NIBBLE

**ASM-9** : TO CONVERT A UNPACKED NUMBER WHICH IS OF DOUBLE WORD TYPE(8 DIGIT) TO PACKED NUMBER
	CONVERTING 01020304H - 1234H WHERE Y IS THE RESULT VARIABLE

**ASM-10** : LINEAR SEARCH BY COMPARING ELEMENT TO BE SEARCHED IN THE BYTE ARRAY WITH ALL THE
	 ELEMENTS IN THE ARRAY ONE BY ONE. AND IF FOUND AFTER COMPARE JUMMP TO LABEL FOUND
	 AND SET FLAG=1 OTHERWISE IF NOT FOUND JUMP TOLABEL NOT FOUND AND HALT THE PROCESS 

**ASM-11** : TO FIND THE 2'S COMPLEMENT OF A WORD TYPE ARRAY AND STORE THE RESULT IN X 

**ASM-12** : BINARY SEARCH OF AN ELEMENT
